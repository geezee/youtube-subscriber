youtube-subscriber is a script that downloads and serves youtube videos from
channels. Here's a tutorial on how to use it:


SETUP:
------
You need to start by setting up the environment. Pick a folder (say
$HOME/youtube) which will hold all the videos and metadata and execute:

    yt-subscriber setup $HOME/youtube


MANAGING SUBSCRIPTIONS:
-----------------------

To subscribe to a channel you need to find the channel's ID (refer to the bottom
of this document to see how to accomplish that). Once you've obtained the id
you can execute the following command: (this id corresponds to the Kurzgesagt
channel)

    yt-subscriber subscribe UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q

To unsubscribe from the channel you can run

    yt-subscriber unsubscribe UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q

To list all your subscriptions you can run

    yt-subscriber list


DOWNLOADING AND SERVING:
------------------------

To download the latest 5 videos of every subscription in highest definition you
can execute:

    yt-subscriber sync

To modify the limit (5) to something else, or to modify the format of the video
downloaded you can edit the yt-subscriber configuration file which resides in
$HOME/.yt-subscriber.conf

Finally, to serve the videos you need to host them somewhere. Assuming you ran
a server in your $HOME/youtube folder on port 8080 (e.g. by running
`php -S localhost:8080` in $HOME/youtube) you can execute

    yt-subscriber serve "http://localhost:8080/downloads" > output.html
    firefox output.html

Assuming you do not want to host the files somewhere you can also use

    yt-subscriber serve "file://$HOME/youtube/downloads" > output.html


USEFUL FILES:
-------------

- $HOME/youtube/yt-subscriber.log contains a list of all the things
  yt-subscriber was used for (and what it did).

- $HOME/youtube/downloads/*/videos.tsv is a bunch of tab-seperated values
  listing all the info about the downloaded videos of the channel. The first
  column is the id of the video, the second is the publishing date, and the
  last is the title of the video.


HOW TO FIND A CHANNEL'S ID:
---------------------------

If you are already subscribed to a channel you can get its ID by navigating
to the channel's URL from your list of subscriptions via the sidebar on the left
inside Youtube.

Otherwise you can navigate to the channel's webpage, open up the source of the
webpage (or prepend the URL with view-source:) and search for "channelId" and
copy the value next to first match (it should look something like the one in
the example above)
