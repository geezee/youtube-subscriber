youtube-subscriber is a collection of scripts that downloads and serves
videos from youtube channels.

download-channels downloads the five latest videos of the youtube channels
provided to it. It will also set up the environment by itself, all you need to
do is to modify the TARGET_DOWNLOADS variable (default value is
$HOME/.youtube/downloads).

make-html uses the template html-template.html to output (stdout) an html
file that lists the thumbnails (and title and uploader) of all the videos
linking to the mp4 files.



TUTORIAL
--------

That's how you subscribe to channels. You just write their username in a file.

    # My recomendations
    echo "BryanLunduke" >> $HOME/.youtube/channels
    echo "standupmaths" >> $HOME/.youtube/channels
    echo "Kurzgesagt"   >> $HOME/.youtube/channels

And that's how you download the last 5 videos of every channel.
You can change that 5 to something else (it has to be <=30), it's on line 38
You can make a cron job that runs this command.
Don't panic, it won't try to redownload videos it already downloaded
There's also a log in $HOME/.youtube/downloads/download.log

    cat $HOME/.youtube/channels | xargs download-channels

You can also do

    download-channels BryanLunduke standupmaths Kurzgesagt

Once everything's downloaded you can finally run

    make-html > youtube-subscriber.html
    firefox  youtube-subscriber.html



PROBLEMS
--------

- you cannot subscribe to channels that do not have usernames
- it downloads the highest quality videos (no config available)
